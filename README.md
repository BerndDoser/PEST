# Preprocessing Engine for Spherinator Training (PEST) 

PEST is a set of Python routines
to preprocess simulation data and generate training data for Spherinator, including arbitrary single- and multi-channel images, maps, and point clouds. 
It is currently designed to work with IllustrisTNG data, either through the web-based API or locally using downloaded snapshots.
